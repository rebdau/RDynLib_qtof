# In case of duplicated assignments: Resolving multiple assignments of MS2 spectra to features

# We evaluate the cases above to reduce/remove multiple
# assignments and keep only a single MS2-feature association. First, we
# select the duplicated MS2 spectra by identifying those with the same
# *dataOrigin* and *scanIndex* but different *feature_id* to detect
# duplicates assigned to multiple features. From these duplicated MS2
# spectra, we then check if the difference between the precursor m/z of the
# MS2 and the median m/z of the feature (*feature_mzmed*) is within the
# defined threshold. Only those within the threshold are considered valid
# matches. If no valid match is found, the first mapping is kept and all
# feature IDs are stored as ambiguous. If multiple valid matches are found,
# the feature whose retention time (*feature_rtmed*) is closest to the MS2
# retention time is selected, and the remaining ones are marked as ambiguous.
# All unique (non-duplicated) MS2-feature mappings are retained directly.
# The result is a filtered MS2 object containing only unique assignments and
# an *ambiguous* field listing alternative feature IDs for each retained MS2.

#' @param ms2 A `Spectra` object containing MS2 spectra and their associated
#' feature metadata (including `feature_id`, `feature_mzmed`, and `feature_rtmed`).
#' @param threshold Numeric(1). Maximum allowed difference between precursor m/z
#' of the MS2 spectrum and the feature median m/z (*feature_mzmed*) to be
#' considered a valid match (default = 0.002).
